<!--
The editing process in the careerhub GUI interface does not return all the html lines that were stored.
This file records what should be in the element at the top of the page
Method:
- Decide what changes are needed and update here
- Visit the theme edit page eg https://www.careerhub.uq.edu.au/Admin/SubSites/Layout.aspx?id=14
- Click on the word '(text)' in the header of the example-layout (if this isnt available, drag the 'text' item from
the layout options into the header field, then click)
- Click on the angle bracket icon ('<>') - a very short area will load with white markup on a black background
- select this text and delete
- paste in the markup below
- click OK
- reload the target page to confirm (the change should be instant)
